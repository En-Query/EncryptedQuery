This is a simple example to test the Encrypted Query in standalone mode.

Pre-Requisites:
Generate the encrypted query jar file 
Update the shell scripts to point to the jar file.

Execution:
Execute the run_simple_example.sh script to perform a complete exercise (Generate Query, Run Responder, Decrypt Result)
You can also execute these steps individually by executing:
generate_query.sh               <-- Generate the Query 
run_responder_standalone.sh     <-- Run the responder 
decrypt_result.sh               <-- Decrypt the result

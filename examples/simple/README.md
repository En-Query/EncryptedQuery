This is a simple example to test the Encrypted Query in standalone mode.

**Pre-Requisites:**
Build the Encrypted Query Application. 

Execution:
Execute the `run_simple_example.sh` script to perform a complete exercise (Generate Query, Run Responder, Decrypt Result)
You can also execute these steps individually by executing:
1. `generate_query.sh`               <-- Generate the Query 
2. `run_responder_standalone.sh`     <-- Run the responder 
3. `decrypt_result.sh`               <-- Decrypt the result

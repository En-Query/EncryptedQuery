			Bundles:
				encryptedquery-responder-data-mariadb  
				encryptedquery-responder-data-derby bundle
				
			At deploy time, only one of the bundles is deployed.
			  
			This is to deal with differences in each database, for example: MariaDB does not offer
			sequence generators, so we customize entity mapping differently.

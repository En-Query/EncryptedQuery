    Class to store relinearization keys.

    @par Relinearization
    Concretely, an relinearization key corresponding to a power K of the secret 
    key can be used in the relinearization operation to change a ciphertext of size 
    K+1 to size K. Recall that the smallest possible size for a ciphertext is 2, 
    so the first relinearization key is corresponds to the square of the secret 
    key. The second relinearization key corresponds to the cube of the secret key, 
    and so on. For example, to relinearize a ciphertext of size 7 back to size 2, 
    one would need 5 relinearization keys, although it is hard to imagine a situation 
    where it makes sense to have size 7 ciphertexts, as operating on such objects 
    would be very slow. Most commonly only one relinearization key is needed, and 
    relinearization is performed after every multiplication. 

    @par Decomposition Bit Count
    Decomposition bit count (dbc) is a parameter that describes a performance 
    trade-off in the relinearization process. Namely, in the relinearization process 
    the polynomials in the ciphertexts (with large coefficients) get decomposed 
    into a smaller base 2^dbc, coefficient-wise. Each of the decomposition factors 
    corresponds to a piece of data in the relinearization key, so the smaller the 
    dbc is, the larger the relinearization keys are. Moreover, a smaller dbc results 
    in less invariant noise budget being consumed in the relinearization process. 
    However, using a large dbc is much faster, and often one would want to optimize 
    the dbc to be as large as possible for performance. The dbc is upper-bounded 
    by the value of 60, and lower-bounded by the value of 1.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from RelinKeys is thread-safe as long as no other thread 
    is concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure 
    storing the relinearization keys not being thread-safe.

    @see PublicKey for the class that stores the public key.
